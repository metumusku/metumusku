<p>So, you are a complete beginner and have been hearing about DeFi and Crypto. You&rsquo;d also love to get started. Well, you are in the right place!</p>

<p>This article will be part of a beginner-friendly series created to introduce you to decentralized finance (DeFi). This series will focus on explaining common terms and providing actionable steps to the question &ldquo;How do I get started with DeFi and digital assets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the end of this article, you will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Learn the best practices for keeping your assets safe of MetaMask</li>
	<li>Set up a password manager</li>
	<li>Be able to explain MetaMask to a friend</li>
	<li>Setup MetaMask</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://metumusku">MetaMask</a> is the most popular non-custodial wallet that holds your Ethereum based assets, be it a token, NFT art, or even your Ethereum identity. Non-custodial means that MetaMask doesn&rsquo;t host or store your assets. Instead, MetaMask generates passwords and keys locally on your device, so only you have access to your accounts and data. You are 100% in control of what information you share with applications, and what to keep private.</p>

<p>With great power (of control and privacy) comes great responsibility. Here are some simple but essential security habits that will keep you surfing Web3 applications and using DeFi applications with confidence. ESSENTIAL security habits.</p>

<h3><strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION:</strong></h3>

<p>The three most important things to know are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t ever share your SECRET recovery phrase.</li>
	<li>Backup your SECRET recovery phrase in a couple of secure locations, such as a password manager, cold wallet, steel wallet or on a written and secured piece of paper (preferably laminated and waterproof).</li>
	<li>Keep your SECRET recovery phrase secret, keep it safe.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember how we said that with MetaMask, you have unparalleled privacy and control over your assets? Only YOU will have access to your SECRET recovery phrase.&nbsp;<a href="http://metumusku">MetaMask</a><strong> is not able to reset your account or get your password.</strong>&nbsp;Never trust anyone that asks for your SECRET recovery phrase aka SECRET recovery phrase to restore your account. Remember, the SECRET recovery phrase and SECRET recovery phrase are the same things. This is a phishing attack.</p>

<p><img alt=":bulb:" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12" style="height:20px; width:20px" title=":bulb:" />A SECRET recovery phrase (aka seed phrase) is a 12-word phrase that accesses your accounts. IT CANNOT BE RESET BY ANYONE. If shared, it is compromised and you must move your funds to a NEW WALLET immediately. If not, your account can be drained. Due to how the blockchain is designed,&nbsp;<strong>we CANNOT reverse transactions</strong>. Once your accounts are drained, you will NOT get your funds back.</p>

<p>Due to the confusion caused by this term MetaMask calls it a&nbsp;<strong>secret recovery phrase</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>NEVER share your SECRET recovery phrase aka secret recovery phrase</strong>. From here on in we will call it a secret recovery phrase, but be aware that a SECRET recovery phrase is a secret recovery phrase.</p>

<p><img alt=":bulb:" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12" style="height:20px; width:20px" title=":bulb:" />&nbsp;Phishing is a form of social engineering where a hacker impersonates a trustworthy entity to get sensitive information from a target such as data, usernames, passwords or any other sensitive details. An example might be someone on Telegram offering to help you if you send them your secret recovery phrase.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional accounts you might have with a Web2 company, neither MetaMask nor anyone else are able to reset your account or retrieve a password.</p>

<p>The point of being decentralized is that you alone have complete control over these important keys. A simple explanation is, &ldquo;not your keys, not your wallet&rdquo;. If you do not ultimately control the keys to your financial castle, it&rsquo;s not yours. We will explain more in-depth why this is a powerful new concept for the web in a future post to keep this article focused and actionable.</p>

<p><img alt=":bulb:" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/bulb.png?v=12" style="height:20px; width:20px" title=":bulb:" />If you could lose sleep because of possible lost funds, then you should take this section seriously. Adopting these habits and setup will help keep your funds safe in the long run.</p>

<h3>Set up your Password Manager:</h3>

<p>Before you set up MetaMask, we should set up a password manager. Password managers are a unicorn in the security field since they increase convenience and security. Usually, one comes at the expense of the other.</p>

<p>you up to only remember one password to access all your other passwords securely.</p>

<p>Why do you need a Password Manager?</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>They will make your life easier since you will only have to remember one password.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>They generate passwords that are random, long, and hard to hack for better security.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>They create new passwords so you won&rsquo;t have to reuse old ones.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>You can store your MetaMask secret recovery phrase here initially to reduce the chance of losing your information.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Some popular password managers are&nbsp;<a href="https://1password.com/">1Password&nbsp;199</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass&nbsp;72</a>. There are others as well. Pick the one that has reviews from credible sources and works best for you. It is highly recommended you get the paid version. If you plan on having more crypto than the cost of a yearly subscription, then it is a good trade-off for greater security.</p>

<p>Hackers can access your crypto by breaking into your email accounts, impersonating your phone number and/or leveraging your digital presence to trick others into revealing personal information. By completely hardening your passwords across all accounts, you can reduce these attacks.</p>

<h2>How To Create A Strong Password for your Password Manager: The Mind Map Method</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Think of the layout of your childhood room or the location of a personal non-public place that doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore.</li>
	<li>List the items in the order you walk into the room or location.</li>
	<li>Use this list as a password.</li>
	<li>Add special characters and symbols in between each word to make brute force cracking harder.</li>
	<li>The longer the password, the more secure.</li>
</ol>

<p>An example can be:<br />

<h2><img alt=":x:" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/x.png?v=12" style="height:20px; width:20px" title=":x:" />DON&rsquo;T:</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Reuse the master password used elsewhere for password manager.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Saving your password manager&rsquo;s master password in phone&rsquo;s notes, email or on your desktop.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt=":white_check_mark:" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/white_check_mark.png?v=12" style="height:20px; width:20px" title=":white_check_mark:" />DO:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Practice entering the master password often to memorize it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Create a unique and memorable master password.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Make your master password typable and easy enough to remember for you.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Backup your password manager account:</p>

<p>Once you set up your password, download the emergency backup kit for your password. Print this piece of paper and save it in a SECURE location. If the location is fireproof, it is even better. This emergency backup kit will help reset your password manager&rsquo;s master password in case you forget it.</p>
